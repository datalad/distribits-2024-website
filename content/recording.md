## Information on media usage/coverage for in-person attendees

For the distribits 2024 Meeting, at Haus der Universität Düsseldorf, Apr 4-6 2024, talks and on-stage discussions will be recorded and streamed (YouTube) in order to spread information beyond the group of people who have the chance to participate in-person.

These recordings depict the speaker and slides of a talk, and/or discussants on the stage.

During Q&A sessions audio is recorded and streamed from individual audience members who are asking questions.

If you (as an in-person audience member) have any concerns being recorded, please be mindful of the position of the cameras, and the audience microphones passed around during Q&A sessions.

The “Distribits space” on Matrix, provides a “Distribits meeting Q&A” room, where questions can be submitted to be asked by a moderator on behalf of a submitter.

If you have questions, please contact any organizer (any person with an “organizer” tag on their name badge), or email distribits-org@fz-juelich.de.

If you are posting pictures taken at the event, be mindful of any privacy concerns of depicted individuals, and their “right to one’s own image” (Recht am eigenen Bild).
