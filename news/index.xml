The new meeting dates are Apr 4-6 2024.
This move was necessary due to a large trade fair in DÃ¼sseldorf on the original dates. Hotel and apartment availability is already extremely limited, and for many prohibitively expensive. We gauged the community&amp;rsquo;s feeling before making this decision, and he majority of speakers and attendees responded favorably to the move, although we do recognize the challenges that this causes for some.</description></item><item><title>Notifications sent and Late Registration opens</title><link>https://distribits.live/news/notifications-sent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://distribits.live/news/notifications-sent/</guid><description>We have sent out notifications by email to all who submitted conference and hackathon submissions.
