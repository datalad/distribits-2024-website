It is organized by the people behind the git-annex and DataLad projects. The event will comprise a two-day conference and an additional hackathon day.\nConference We are planning the conference as a single-track event. Participation will be free of charge for attendees, but requires registration. Space is limited, so attendees will be selected and confirmed based on the information they provide in their registration. People who are actively contributing to the program will have priority.\nFor this first meeting the format of contributions is pretty flexible. We envision, but are not limited to:\nTalks: presentations (ca. 20-30 minutes, final duration will be communicated to speakers) on research, case studies, practical applications or theoretical developments. Lightning Talks: quick five-minute presentations that introduce new ideas, projects, demo software, or share tips and tricks about workflows and tools. Discussions: moderated conversations with a panel about particular topics or issues. Proposals should include a list of panelists and a moderator. Hackathon The conference will be followed by a hackathon day providing opportunities for attendees to further connect and collaborate in a more hands-on fashion. The capacity for this event is smaller. We thus ask everyone interested to indicate during the registration if they want to attend the hackathon, too. As we may receive more hackathon registrations than we can accommodate, attendees will be confirmed separately for the hackathon. A project proposal for this day or strong indication of interest during the registration can help us in the selection process. We plan to prioritize efforts that promote interoperability of tools and workflows with free and open solutions.\nAudience We target a diverse audience to promote a stimulating exchange across professions, disciplines, and expertise. Attendees may include researchers, data stewards for collaborative initiatives, data scientists, software developers from academic or corporate environments, or simply enthusiastic individuals. Some people will have expertise with tools like git-annex and DataLad, but this is not a requirement for participation.\nGiven the free nature of the event, attendees are expected to organize and cover their own travel, accommodation, and food. The event takes place in downtown Düsseldorf with plenty of options available.\nSubmit proposals and register Please submit your proposal and register via our online submission/registration system.\nContact and further information For any further questions, please see https://distribits.live or contact distribits-org@fz-juelich.de\n","wordCount":"437","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://distribits.live/about/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"distribits","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://distribits.live/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://distribits.live accesskey=h title="distribits (Alt + H)">distribits</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://distribits.live/about/ title=About><span class=active>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/513x1GEsXvw8rbfBzfRSPdfsu0BYZxPWH7fZIpXMBFE/ title=Registration><span>Registration</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://distribits.live/location/ title=Location><span>Location</span></a></li><li><a href=https://distribits.live/schedule/ title=Schedule><span>Schedule</span></a></li><li><a href=https://distribits.live/news/ title=News><span>News</span></a></li><li><a href=https://distribits.live/code-of-conduct/ title="Code of Conduct"><span>Code of Conduct</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>About</h1><div class=post-meta></div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p><img loading=lazy src=/pics/distribits_logo_a.svg alt="Distribits 2024"></p><h2 id=technologies-for-distributed-data-management>Technologies for distributed data management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#technologies-for-distributed-data-management>#</a></h2><h3 id=april-18th---april-20th-2024-at-haus-der-universität-düsseldorf-germany>April 18th - April 20th, 2024 at “Haus der Universität”, Düsseldorf, Germany<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#april-18th---april-20th-2024-at-haus-der-universität-düsseldorf-germany>#</a></h3><hr><h2 id=call-for-participation>Call for participation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#call-for-participation>#</a></h2><p>The first <strong>distribits</strong> meeting will happen in 2024, and we are inviting all interested parties to join!</p><p>The aim of this meeting is to bring together enthusiasts of tools and workflows in the domain of distributed data.
